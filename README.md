# phone.com-scrub

Flow:
+ Must Upload a .CSV file of phone numbers (thousands of number entries) =  and store all phone number records into a data base. Users can do it in parallel!
+ show total amount of entries uploaded
+ Upon upload; it must scrub all new numbers with existing phone numbers to provide results to the end user.
* show a file of all the unique numbers (newly updated numbers) that were not in the system prior to upload.  (a CSV file the user can download)
* Then also display the duplication entries that were in the data base prior (CSV file they can download).
* fix "Basically we would remove duplicates from excel file first then it would be how many duplicates that is present within the data base"

Admin:
+ the admin must be able to see all of this as well but have a dated log of all the uploads and results.
+ change the password of both types of users
+ erase whole database
+ a batch file with all entries so I can download that if needed
